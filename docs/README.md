# Personal Website @ [chen-anna.com](chen-anna.com)
Built using ```Tailwind CSS, React JS, HTML```. Deployed it using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which is a cloud platform for deploying, previewing, and scaling front-end frameworks and static sites. 

### Want to run locally?
1. Clone repository
2. ```npm install```
3. ```npm run dev```

### Future steps
I did not implement page responsiveness, so the components were designed to suit desktop view. In the future, I plan on accounting for device compatibility.
